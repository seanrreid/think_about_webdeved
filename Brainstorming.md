# Thinking through Dev Education

This is basically just a brain dump…

## JS vs Python first?

| JS                                             | Python                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Gets right into proper “web dev”               | No need to run a browser           |
| Jumpstarts HTML (and some CSS)                 | Instant “Hackerman” feel           |
| Needs Node for CLI                             | No need to explain Node vs Browser |
| Need to use console for non-DOM related output | Intimidating at first?             |

## Start with HTML _then_ move into “programming?

| HTML                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gets some immediate gratification, build it and see it instantly |
| Might not feel like “real” programming?                          |
| Redundant with Foundations?                                      |
| Flows _naturally_ from Foundations?                              |

## Main thoughts

### How can we start a foundation and then “stack” tech on top of it?

Initial thoughts would be:

- Programming Fundamentals using Python
- Intro to Web with HTML/CSS/JS
- Web Apps with JS Frameworks, likely React
- APIs using Python, possibly Django, potentially Flask/FastAPI
- Full Stack projects using all of the above

But, perhaps this makes more sense to “stack?”

- HTML / CSS
- Programming Fundamentals with JS
- Web Apps with JS Framework
- Python APIs/Backend
- Full Stack Project.

Declarative languages, HTML/CSS/SQL kind of throw a small wrench into the “stacking” b/c those paradigms don’t necessarily follow in a natural pattern from the lessons in Imperative programming in JS/Python.

- Counter: JS + DOM makes the leap between the two easier to connect
- Counter to counter: The mental model still requires a shift between “it’s presented this way” and “this is the control flow.”

Would looking into a different way to break it down be beneficial?

- High level pattern in all languages?
  - Functions
  - Variables
  - Objects
- Presentation vs “Computation”
  - How does it look vs what does it do?
  - How are the two things connected?
- Data Structures
  - Markup Languages
  - SQL
  - JSON
  - Rest/GraphQL
